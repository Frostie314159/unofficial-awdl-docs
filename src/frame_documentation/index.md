# Frame Documentation

AWDL piggybacks of normal WiFi management and data frames for communication. AWDL uses AFs for master election, synchronization and service discovery. These AFs are divided into two distinct categories, which will be elaborated on further on the next page. Every AF contains a set of TLVs, of which there are 12 different ones.
